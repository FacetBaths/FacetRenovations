Walk-in shower installations are the most requested bathroom renovation in Chicagoland. Period.

We see it constantly: homeowners who haven't used their bathtub in years finally decide to do something about it. Smart move. But there's a right way and a wrong way to approach this project, and the wrong way will cost you thousands.

Here's everything you need to know about walk-in shower installation in the Chicago area, from someone who's done hundreds of these conversions.

### Why Everyone's Converting to Walk-In Showers

**The Reality:** Most families in Chicagoland don't use bathtubs anymore.

We've removed bathtubs from homes in Lincoln Park where the owners admitted they'd never filled it once. Busy professionals in Evanston who shower every morning but haven't taken a bath since college. Families with teenagers in Naperville who outgrew bath time years ago.

Walk-in showers aren't just trendy—they solve real problems:
- **Easier daily use** for everyone over 40
- **More space** in smaller Chicago bathrooms
- **Better accessibility** as you age
- **Higher resale value** in most Chicagoland markets

**What's Included:**

- Glass shower door or curtain rod *(budget glass doors typically use thin 3/16" glass without protective coatings or premium features)*

*Popular in Arlington Heights, Mount Prospect, and other areas with aging homeowners.*

### Our Installation Process vs. Traditional Contractors

**The Traditional Way:** Up to 2 weeks, multiple trips, surprise charges, 43% customer dissatisfaction.

**Our Way:** 1-2 days, start to finish, fixed contract pricing, lifetime warranty.

Here's how we do tub-to-shower conversions differently:

### Day 1: Complete Installation
**Morning:** Tub removal, disposal, and prep work
**Afternoon:** Plumbing modifications, waterproofing, and wall installation
**Evening:** You're using your new shower (after allowing silicone to cure of course.)

*Most conversions complete in one day. Complex jobs may extend to day 2.*

### Why We're Different from Traditional Contractors

#### We Stick to Our Timeline
**Typical Contractor:** "We'll be back next week" — then disappears for days.
**Us:** Once we start, we're there until we finish. Period.

#### One Project at a Time
**Typical Contractor:** Juggles multiple jobs, leaves you waiting for parts or scheduling.
**Us:** All materials acquired before we schedule. No interruptions, no delays.

#### Fixed Contract Pricing
**Typical Contractor:** "Estimates" that turn into surprise charges and change orders.
**Us:** Contract price is final. At the time of writing, we've never added charges to a completed project.

#### Lifetime Warranty
**Typical Contractor:** 1-2 year warranty, if you're lucky.
**Us:** Everything we touch is warranted for life. We stand behind our work.

#### Brand Protection
**Typical Contractor:** Fly-by-night operations that can potentially disappear when problems arise.
**Us:** Established business with a reputation to protect. We can't afford unsatisfied customers.

### The Numbers Don't Lie

**43% of homeowners are unsatisfied with their contractor experience.** 
*That's almost half of all renovation projects.*

Common complaints:
- Projects drag on for weeks
- Contractors don't show up when promised  
- Surprise charges and "unforeseen" costs
- Poor communication and follow-through
- Shoddy work that needs fixing

*We built our process specifically to avoid these problems.*

#### Seasonal Installation Considerations

**Best Times for Installation:**
- **Spring/Fall:** Ideal weather, standard pricing
- **Winter:** 10-15% savings on labor, but material delivery can be delayed
- **Summer:** Highest demand, book 6-8 weeks ahead

#### Building Age Challenges

**Pre-1970 Homes:** Budget an extra $1,500-$3,000 for potential:
- Lead paint remediation
- Asbestos tile removal  
- Electrical system updates

**1980s-1990s Homes:** Usually straightforward installations with minimal surprises.

### Walk-In Shower Design Options for Chicago Homes

#### Glass Enclosures

**Frameless Glass ($1,800-$3,200):**
- Clean, modern look
- Easier to clean
- Makes small bathrooms feel larger
- *Most popular in Lincoln Park and Lakeview*

**Semi-Frameless ($1,200-$2,200):**
- Good balance of cost and style
- Easier installation
- *Common choice in suburban installations*

#### Shower Flooring

**Tile Floors:**
- **Pros:** Unlimited design options, durable
- **Cons:** Grout maintenance, slip concerns when wet

**Solid Surface Pans:**
- **Pros:** No grout, completely waterproof, non-slip textures available
- **Cons:** Limited color options

|----------|------------|------|------|
| **Fiberglass** | $9,000-$12,000 | • Cheap<br>• Easy to find | • Stains<br>• Cracks<br>• Bounces<br>• Often unsafe<br>• No warranty |

| **Tile** | $25,000-$30,000 | • Design options<br>• Can look good new | • Long installation<br>• Porous grout<br>• Extensive cleaning<br>• Grout maintenance<br>• No warranty |
| **Natural Stone Slabs** | $30,000-$45,000 | • Look nice<br>• Durable | • LONG install process<br>• Grout lines<br>• REQUIRES RE-SEALING (every 3-4 months)<br>• Can discolor<br>• Expensive |
| **Solid Surface** | $12,000 - $20,000  | • Beautiful designs<br>• Simple and easy to clean<br>• Durable<br>• Best ROI for home value<br>• Waterproof<br>• Lifetime warranties | • Still have to choose the right company |

*Solid surface walls are increasingly popular because they eliminate weekend grout cleaning and offer the best combination of durability, maintenance, and warranty protection.*

### Common Walk-In Shower Installation Mistakes

#### Inadequate Waterproofing
Cheap contractors skip proper membrane systems. Results in expensive repairs within 2-3 years.

#### Poor Drainage Planning  
Incorrect slope or drain placement leads to standing water. Especially problematic in Chicago's hard water areas.

#### Ignoring Ventilation
Insufficient exhaust fans cause mold issues. Critical in Chicago's humid summers.

#### Cutting Corners on Glass
Cheap shower doors leak and fog up. Quality glass doors last 15+ years.

### Questions to Ask Chicagoland Shower Contractors

#### Before You Hire:
1. "Are you properly/adequately insured and registered to do business in Illinois?"
2. "How do you handle waterproofing in Chicago's climate?"
3. "What's your process for permits and inspections?"
4. "Can I see recent installations in my area?"
5. "What warranty do you provide on installation?"

#### Red Flags:
- No fixed business address in Chicagoland
- Requires full payment upfront
- Can't provide local references *(though this is more difficult nowadays as people don't like to be bothered by strangers)*
- Significantly lower bid than others *(this is the most frequent trap for under-informed homeowners - corners will be cut)*

### Walk-In Shower Installation Timeline

**Planning Phase:** 1 week
- Design consultation and material selection
- Scheduling and material acquisition

**Installation Phase:** 1-2 days  
- Complete start-to-finish installation
- Using your new shower that evening (most jobs)

**Payback Period:** Immediate in daily convenience, 5-7 years financially

*Data from our completed projects and local real estate analysis.*
