## Smart Ways to Control Costs

**Waterproofing:** Never skimp here. Chicago's humidity and temperature swings demand quality moisture barriers.

**Plumbing:** Upgrade supply lines and drainage while walls are open. Much cheaper now than later.

**Ventilation:** Proper exhaust fans prevent mold issues common in Chicago's climate.

### Where to Save Money
**Fixtures:** Mid-range fixtures (Kohler, American Standard) offer 90% of premium performance at 60% of the cost.

**Tile:** Use premium tile as accent pieces, standard tile for large areas.
